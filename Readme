**Fruit Ninja Nostalgia** is a modern reimagining of the legendary mobile game, redesigned as a **typing game**. Instead of swiping your finger across a screen, you must use your keyboard skills and reflexes to slice through fruits before they fall.

## 🎮 Game Concept

While browsing through the app store, a wave of nostalgia hits you as you see *Fruit Ninja*. This project aims to recreate that frantic experience where every keystroke replaces the blade's edge.

### Core Rules
* **Slicing:** Press the correct keys associated with the fruits to slice them and score points.
* **Combos:** Slice multiple fruits in a single sequence to earn progressive combo bonuses (e.g., +1 for one fruit, +2 for three fruits at once, +3 for four, etc.).
* **Strikes:** Every missed fruit costs you a life. Reach **3 strikes**, and it’s Game Over.
* **Bombs:** Avoid them at all costs! Slicing a bomb ends the game instantly.
* **Ice Cubes:** Slice these to freeze time for **3 to 5 seconds**.
* **Score:** Your final score is the total number of fruits sliced during the session.
