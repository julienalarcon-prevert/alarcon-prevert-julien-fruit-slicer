Instead of swiping your finger across a screen, you must use your keyboard skills and reflexes to slice through fruits before they fall.🎮 Game ConceptWhile browsing through the app store, a wave of nostalgia hits you as you see Fruit Ninja.

Slicing a bomb ends the game instantly.Ice Cubes: Slice these to freeze time for 3 to 5 seconds.🚀 Features🛠️ Gameplay MechanicsInput System: High-responsiveness keyboard detection for a seamless experience.Dynamic Scoring: Real-time score calculation based on fruit types and combos.Difficulty Scaling: Increasing fruit spawn rates and bomb frequency as the game progresses.🌟 Advanced Features (Bonus)Special Power-ups:Golden Fruit: Grants a massive point boost.Double Score Fruit: Doubles all points earned for a limited time.Shield Fruit: Provides temporary protection against bombs.Game Modes:Classic: Survive as long as possible with 3 strikes.Challenge: Achieve the highest score within a set time limit.Customization: Multilingual support (words in different languages) and difficulty settings.Immersive Audio: Slicing sound effects and ambient background music.🛠️ Installation & SetupClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-name/fruit-slicer.git
